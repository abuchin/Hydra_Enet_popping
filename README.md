Network dynamics: volume increase drives the activity of the sensory neurons (green) increasing the spiking in the whole network. 
Via excitable cells (blue) the activity reaches the actuator neurons. Once their activity reaches the threshold it leads to the negative 
volume regulation via step nonlinearity. It rapidly decreases the volume, stopping the neural activity due to the absence of sensory input. Then the volume continues to grow leading to the repeat of the cycle.
